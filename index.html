            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>To implement responsive web design using html and css and provide an optimal visual user-experience to users across multiple devices a step by step system like this one may be a good guideline.

                Responsive design principles
                Knowing about and how to use core principles of responsive web design including media queries, fluid grids and flexible layouts to dynamically adjust web content.

                Set the viewport
                To optimise pages for a variety of devices setting a meta viewport tag is important. To ensure proper scaling, in the <head> section of the html page include the meta tag â€œ<meta name="viewport" content=width=device-width, initial-scale=1>. The value width=device-width will ensure the page matches the devices width and independent pixels.

                Use a flexible grid
                There are a number of layout methods that can be used including Flexbox, Grid layout and Multicol. For this example instead of using the Grid layout technique were a container widths and column widths are defined with percentages, the fr unit which represents a portion of space in a contain can be used.
                i.e
                .container {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
                }

                Use flexible images
                Setting the max-width to 100% within a container will ensure images scale proportionally and prevent overflow.


                Apply Media Queries and Features
                Use media queries to apply specific CSS rules that are based on screen sizing and capabilities. For example targeted media features any-hover and any-pointer to optimise the website for touch-based devices like phones and iPads and precise pointer such as computers with mouses or touchpads.
                @media (any-hover: hover)</p>
